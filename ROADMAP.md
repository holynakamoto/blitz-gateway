- **HTTP/2 over TLS**: ~2,528 RPS (tested in VM, production should be much higher)
- **Latency**: 50-100μs per request (HTTP), 100-200μs (TLS)
- **Memory**: 800MB buffer pool + ~32KB per TLS connection
- **Success Rate**: 99.655% (99,655/100,000 requests successful in load test)

### 🚧 Known Limitations
- ⚠️ **Huffman Decoding** - HPACK Huffman decoding not fully implemented (causes path corruption with Huffman-encoded header values, but doesn't break core functionality)
- ⚠️ **Intermittent TLS Errors** - Occasional "bad record mac" errors (mostly resolved, but can occur under high load)
- ⚠️ **Stream Closure** - Occasional "stream not closed cleanly" errors (minor issue, doesn't affect functionality)
- No routing or load balancing
- Single-threaded (one io_uring ring)
- Self-signed certificates only
- No configuration management
- No metrics/monitoring
